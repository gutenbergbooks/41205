<h3>
<span>AN EPITAPH IN ST. GILES'S, CRIPPLEGATE, POSSIBLY BY MILTON.</span>
</h3>

<p>The chief glory of the church of St. Giles, Cripplegate, is the
possession of Milton's dust. But this does not constitute its only
distinction. It boasts a magnificent organ, and the most beautiful
epitaph with which I am acquainted. As this last may be as much of a
stranger to many of your readers as it was to me, and may bestow upon
the curious in such matters some portion of the pleasure which its
discovery gave me, I venture to crave for it a nook in your columns.
Considerably to the right of the pulpit, at no great distance, if I
recollect aright, to the left of the main entrance, is a monument to
William Staples, a citizen of London, who died in 1650, whereon is
inscribed the following elegiac couplet:</p>

<div class="poem">

     <p> "Quod cum c&oelig;licolis habitus, pars altera nostri,</p>
      <p>Non dolet, hic tantûm me superesse dolet."</p>

</div>

<p>Which may be thus Englished:</p>

<div class="poem">

      <p>"That Heaven's thy home, I grieve not, soul most dear;</p>
     <p> I grieve but for myself, the lingerer here."</p>

</div>

<p>Below the inscription are the touching words&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">

      <p>"Hoc posuit m&oelig;stissima uxor, Sara."</p>

</div>

<p>Putting aside all partiality for one's own discovery, I confess that I
do not know the fellow of this epitaph. It realises one's ideal of an
epitaph, inasmuch as it combines exceeding brevity and beauty of
expression with exceeding fulness of thought and feeling. Love, sorrow,
and faith, bereaved affection and trustful piety, find most ample and
exquisite utterance in these two lines. It has scarcely won the fame to
which it is entitled: I have never met with it in any collection of
epitaphs. The authorship would have done no dishonour to Milton himself,
to whose place of sepulture it lends, if possible, an additional
consecration. Curiously enough, not merely its singular excellence, but
also its date, and one or two other circumstances, give some little
encouragement to the idea of Miltonic ownership. The monument bears the
date of 1650, when Milton was in the fulness of his powers and
reputation. He was especially connected with Cripplegate Church; more
than one of his many London abodes were in its neighbourhood. There, in
the earlier part of his London life, during his residence in Aldersgate
Street, he may have often worshipped; there his father lay; there he
meant his own sepulchre to be. He who honoured "the religious memory of
Mrs. Catharine Thomson, my Christian Friend," with his most glorious
sonnet, would not have disdained to bestow a couplet upon the grief of
another obscure friend. There are, then, certain presumptions in favour
of Cripplegate Church containing an epitaph by Milton. But it does not
appear in any collection of the works of one who was so careful of his
smallest and most juvenile productions. This fact, I must confess, is
quite<a id="Page_362"></a> <span class="pagenum">[362]</span> strong enough to demolish a likely and pleasing fancy. The
epitaph, however, though it may not be Miltonic, has every possible
merit, and may find favour with such of your readers as delight in the
literature of tombstones.</p>

<h3>
<span>LIABILITY TO ERROR.</span>
</h3>


<p>As I always strive to be accurate when writing for the press, an
accidental error should not give me much compunction; nevertheless, a
touch of the feeling is sure to obtrude itself on such occasions. Even
the apprehension of having added to the mass of current errors gives me
a fit of uneasiness, and having just recovered from an attack of that
description it may not be amiss to report the case for the benefit of
future patients.</p>

<p>When I wrote a memorandum on James Wilson, in reply to the query of
professor D<span class="smcap lowercase">E</span> M<span class="smcap lowercase">ORGAN</span>, I stated that the united libraries of Pemberton and
Wilson were sold in 1772. <i>It was guess-work.</i></p>

<p>I recollected that the two libraries were sold in conjunction, but could
not recollect the date. On consulting the printed <i>List of the original
catalogues</i> of libraries sold by auction by Mr. Baker and his successors
in the years 1744-1828, which was issued by the firm in the latter year,
the date appeared to be 1757. With that evidence, I penned a short
comment on the remarkable circumstance of the two learned friends
resolving to dispose of their libraries at the same time, on their
surviving the separation from their beloved books for fourteen years,
and on their dying within about six months of each other.</p>

<p>Some undefinable suspicions arose in my mind at this point of the
inquiry. Now, the original sale catalogue is in existence, and
accessible on proper application. I examined it. The sale commenced on
<i>Monday, February the 24th</i>. The year 1757 is added in <i>manuscript</i>;
and, since Pemberton and Wilson are described as <i>lately deceased</i>, it
is an undoubted error. So I tore up my sentimental scrap, leaving the
fragments on the table for the benefit of autograph collectors, and
replaced it with the six lines which conclude my reply. On reaching
home, I turned to the <i>Chronology of history</i>: the dominical letter was
just what I wished it to be! The <i>Book of almanacs</i> added to my
comfortable sensations.</p>

<p>On a re-examination of my notes, it appeared that the united libraries
were sold by Baker and Leigh. Now, according to the above-described
<i>List of catalogues</i>, the partnership between Baker and Leigh did not
take place till 1775. The phrase <i>lately deceased</i>, applied to Pemberton
and Wilson, is not very precise; the sale, however, must have been after
1774. Resolved to pursue the inquiry, I examined a copy of the catalogue
in the royal library in the British Museum. It is bound with the
catalogue of the library of Edward Stanley, Esq., secretary to the
customs, which was sold in February 1776, and follows it. The volume is
lettered 1776. As the libraries of Pemberton and Wilson were to be
<i>viewed on Monday the 17th</i>, I turned to that day in the Stanley sale;
it was <i>Monday the 17th</i>. This seemed to prove that the two collections
were sold in the same year. Chronology says otherwise: the <i>Monday the
17th</i> of the Stanley catalogue is an error of the printer; and the
lettering, with regard to Pemberton and Wilson, is an error of the
binder!</p>

<p>Believing, on the evidence above stated, that the sale was after the
year 1774, I came to the conclusion that it was in 1777&mdash;in which year
the 24th February fell on Monday. On further search at home, I met with
the catalogue in question. It is in a volume which was successively in
the possession of Dent and Heber, and contains the rare Fairfax
catalogue; also, <i>A catalogue of the very valuable library of Phillip
Carteret Webb, Esq.</i>, which was sold by <i>Baker and Leigh</i> in 1771. It
now became evident that the libraries of Pemberton and Wilson might have
been sold by <i>Baker and Leigh</i> in 1772; and on examining the<i> Public
advertiser</i> for that year, I found the sale advertised on Thursday the
20th of February. So I was right by <i>chance</i>, and in spite of manuscript
and printed authorities. Here ends the case.</p>

<p>Another anecdote in connexion with this inquiry deserves to be recorded.
I had read the life of Pemberton in the <i>General biographical
dictionary</i>. Chalmers therein states that his course of lectures on
chemistry, "was published in 1771, by his friend Dr. James Wilson." I
applied for the volume at the British Museum. By a rare accident the
<i>Scheme for a course of chemistry</i> was produced instead of the <i>Course
of chemistry</i>, and as the day was far advanced, and <i>copy</i> due, I gave
up the pursuit. On examination, it turns out that the volume contains a
memoir of Pemberton in twenty-three pages. Chalmers cites Hutton and
Shaw as his authorities; and <i>Hutton</i>, as I conceive, gives the
substance of it as his own composition! Wilson, in this important
memoir, declares that his intimacy with Pemberton was the <i>greatest
felicity</i> of his life. He dates it the 10th Aug. 1771. He died on the
29th of September in the same year.</p>

<p>Wilson remarks, in his previous work, that on the successful practice of
navigation "depends, in an especial manner, the flourishing state of our
country." To this remark no one can refuse assent. The <i>Dissertation</i> on
the history of the art has fallen into oblivion, because it exists only
in a work which has been superseded by others; but I venture to express
my opinion that a separate edition of it, with such corrections and
additions as might be required, and a continuation to the present time,
would be a desirable addition to scientific literature; and that no one
would perform the task with more ability, or more conscientiously, than
professor D<span class="smcap lowercase">E</span> M<span class="smcap lowercase">ORGAN</span>.</p>

<h3>
<span>BAXTER'S PULPIT.</span>
</h3>


<p>The pulpit formerly used at Kidderminster by Richard Baxter, the eminent
author of <i>The Saint's Rest</i>, is still preserved there. In his day it
stood on the north side of the nave of the parish church (St. Mary's),
against the second pillar from the east. But in 1786, the church was
"repaired, repewed, and beautified," in the style of those good old
times: when, it being thought advisable to have a new pulpit <i>built</i> in
a central situation, Baxter's old pulpit was condemned, and, together
with other pieces of carved work, was offered for sale (!) by the then
churchwardens, as old and useless church furniture. The churchmen of
that day appear to have held the same opinions as their wardens; so the
pulpit (with the exception of its pedestal) was purchased by the
Unitarians of the place. Their successors have carefully preserved it,
and it now stands in a room adjacent to their chapel.</p>

<p>The pulpit is of oak: octagonal in its shape, and properly decorated
with flowers and architectural ornaments, in the well-known style of the
period. Gold letters, inserted in six of the panels, somewhat
ostentatiously informed the congregation that&mdash;</p>

   <p class="center">"ALICE · DAWKX · WIDOW · GAVE · THIS."</p>

<p>On the face of the pulpit, and immediately beneath the preacher's desk,
is the text:</p>

   <p class="center">"PRAISE · THE · LORD."</p>

<p>And round the sounding-board are the words:</p>

   <p class="center">"O · GIVE · THANKS. UNTO · THE · LORD. AND · CALL · UPON · HIS ·
   NAME. DECLARE · HIS · WORSHIP · AMONG · THE · PEOPLE."</p>

<p>On the oak board at the back of the pulpit is the date:</p>

   <p class="center">  "ANNO · 1621."</p>

<p class="noindent">surmounted by a projecting crown and cushion of bold workmanship. The
mariner's compass is painted on the underside of the sounding-board, and
the entire pulpit bears manifest traces of having once been adorned with
gold and colours.</p>

<p>The octagonal pillar and pedestal on which the pulpit once stood, now
serve to support the floor of a bookseller's shop in the High Street.</p>

<p>Within the room where the pulpit is now preserved is placed a folio copy
of Baxter's work in four volumes, and an engraving of "the reverend and
learned Mr. Richard Baxter," taken from the original picture in the
possession of Mr. Fawcett, formerly of Kidderminster. A handsomely
carved chair, formerly the property of Bishop Hall, is also placed near
to the pulpit.</p>

<p>Can any of your correspondents inform me, if any engraving of Baxter's
pulpit has been published? I have made many inquiries, but have never
met with or heard of one. Three years since, I etched on the copper a
correct representation of the present state of the pulpit; when, in
answer to my inquiries, I was told that no one had even sketched it for
many years.</p>

<p>A notice of "Richard Baxter," and his 168 publications, occurs in "N. &amp;
Q.," Vol. iii., p. 370.</p>

<p>I inclose you an impression from the etching just referred to.</p>

<h3>
<span>POPULAR STORIES OF THE ENGLISH PEASANTRY, NO. I.</span>
</h3>

<p>Only a few years before the advent of Ambrose Merton, it was the
sorrowful lament of Picken that he could find no legendary lore among
our English peasantry. The rapid progress of education, according to
him, had long ago banished our household traditions. Want of
acquaintance with the shy and reserved character of John Bull probably
proved a stumbling-block to our collector, for what a rich harvest has
been reaped since his day! Our mythic treasures, however, are far from
being exhausted; and if we wish to emulate our brethren of Deutschland,
we must do yet more. The popular tales and legends which abound among
our rural population, are still for the most part ungarnered. The
folk-tales of the sister kingdoms have been ably chronicled in the pages
of Croker and Chambers, but our own have been almost entirely neglected.
So much indeed is this the case, that we have had recourse to Germany in
order to recruit our exhausted nursery literature; and readers of <i>all</i>
sizes devour with avidity the charming versions of the Messieurs Taylor,
few of them suspecting that stories of like character form the sole
imaginative lore of their uneducated countrymen.</p>

<p>Some years ago while in the country I made a practice of noting down the
more curious traditionary stories which came under my notice; and, with
the kind permission of the Editor, will transfer a few portions of my
researches to the columns of "N. &amp; Q.," in the hope of inducing some of
your rural correspondents to embark in a similar design. I am aware that
certain antiquaries of the old <i>régime</i> still entertain doubts as to the
utility of these collections. As vestiges, however, of primitive
fiction, they will interest the philosophical inquirer; while their
value as contributions to ethnological and philological science has been
recognised by all writers on the subject.</p>

<p>Premising that these tales, however puerile, are not associated with any
such idea by the people among whom they were gathered, permit me to
introduce your readers to "Thoughtful Moll," in whom they will trace a
remarkable resemblance to <i>Die kluge Else</i> of Grimm. It is from
Oxfordshire, and affords no bad specimen of the facetious class of
fables which often enliven the winter's evening hearth-talk. I have
endeavoured to preserve the narrators' style and dialect.<a id="Page_364"></a> <span class="pagenum">[364]</span></p>

<p>In a certain village there once lived a young woman so extremely noted
for prudence and forethought, that she was known among her neighbours as
"Thoughtful Moll." Now this young lady had a thirsty soul of a
sweetheart, who dearly loved a drop of October, and one day when he came
a-wooing to her: "O Moll," says he, "fill us a tot o'yeal, I be most
mortal dry." So Moll took a tot from the shelf and went down the cellar,
where she tarried so long that her father sent down her sister to see
what had come of her. When she got there she found her sister weeping
bitterly. "What ails thee, wench?" said she. "O!" sobbed Moll, "don't ye
see that stwon in the arch, that stands out from the mortar like? Now,
mayhaps, when I be married an have a bwoy, an he comes down here to draw
beer, that big stwon'll fall down on'm and crush'm." "Thoughtful Moll!"
said her admiring sister, and the two sat down and mingled their tears
together. The drink not being forthcoming, another sister is despatched,
and she also stops. Meantime Dob grew chafed at the delay, and went down
himself to look after his love and his beer. When he hears the cause of
the stoppage, he falls into a violent rage, and declares he won't have
Moll unless he can find three bigger fools than herself and sisters. It
is noonday when Dob sets out on his travels; and the first person he saw
was an old woman, who was running about and brandishing her bonnet in
the sunshine: "What bist at, Dame?" says Dob. "Why," said the old woman;
"I'm a ketchin' sunshine in this here bonnet to dry me carn as a' leased
in wet." "Mass!" quoth Dob, "that's one fool." And so on he went till he
came to another Gothanite, who was dragging about the corn-fields a huge
branch of oak. "What may ye be a-doin' wi' that, Measter?" says Dob.
"Kaint ye see?" says the man; "I'm a gettin' the crows to settle on this
branch, they've had a'most all me crop a'ready." "The devil you are!"
said Dob, as he went on his way. He meets no one else for a long time,
and almost despairs of completing his number, when at last he sees an
old woman trying all she could to get a cow to go up a ladder. "What are
ye arter there, Missus?" says he. "Dwunt ye see, young mon?" says she;
"I'm a drivin' this keow up the lather t'eat the grass aff the thack."
"Deary me!" says Dob, "one fool makes many." And so he turned back, and
married Moll; with whom he lived long and happily, if not wisely.<a id="wisely1"></a><a title="Go to footnote 1." href="#fn1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="fn1"></a><a title="Return to text." href="#wisely1" class="label">[1]</a> Glossary.&mdash;<i>Tot</i>, a mug;
 <i>yeal</i>, ale; <i>leased</i>, gleaned;
<i>lather</i>, ladder; <i>thack</i>, thatch.</p>

<p>Besides Grimm's version, we meet with a somewhat similar fable in
Ireland. Vide Gerald Griffin's <i>Collegians</i>, p. 139.</p>

<p>Another pretty numerous class of our popular stories consists of those
in which animals are made the actors. One of the most common of these
relates to the strife between the fox and the hedgehog, who, according
to the good people of Northamptonshire, are the two most astute animals
in creation. How a couple of these worthies once fell out as to which
was the swifter animal; and how, when they had put their speed to the
trial, the cunning urchin contrived to defeat Reynard by placing his
consort in the furrow which was to form the goal: so that when her mate
had made a pretence of starting, she might jump out and feign to be
himself just arrived. And how, after three desperate runs, the
broken-winded fox fell a victim to the deceit, and was compelled to
yield to his adversary; who, ever since that day, has been his most
inveterate enemy. This myth is curious on many accounts, for the
hedgehog has always been regarded as an emblem of subtlety. Grimm gives
a tale precisely similar, with the exception that it is a hare and not a
fox who is deceived by the ruse. Aldrovandus likewise tells us much on
the score of his craft; and it was probably some mythic connexion
between the animals which led Archilochus to class them together in the
adage:</p>

<h3>
<span>FOLK LORE.</span>
</h3>
<h4>
<span><i>Body and Soul</i>.</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;The other day, in a village in Huntingdonshire, an
unbaptized child was buried. A neighbour expressed great sorrow for the
mother because "no bell had been rung over the corpse." On asking why
this circumstance should be so peculiarly a cause of grief, she told me
that it was "because when any one died, the soul never left the body
until the church bell was rung." Is this superstition believed in
elsewhere? And does it arise from mistaken notions regarding "the
passing bell,"&mdash;the "one short peal" which the 67th canon orders to be
rung "after the party's death?"</p>

<h4>
<span><i>Giving Cheese at a Birth</i>.</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;In the county of Northumberland, not far
from the Cheviots, I met with the following custom. When a woman's
confinement is near, a cheese is made, which, when the child is born, is
cut into pieces and distributed among all the houses (without exception)
in the vicinity. If the child is a boy, the pieces of cheese are sent to
the males; if a girl, to the females, each member of a family receiving
a portion. Visitors also come in for their share. Whence did this custom
arise?</p>

<h4>
<span><i>Sneezing</i>.</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;"The custom of blessing persons when they sneeze," says
Brand, "has, without doubt, been derived to the Christian world,
where<a id="Page_365"></a> <span class="pagenum">[365]</span> it generally prevails, from the time of heathenism." In
addition to the interesting notice of the prevalence of this custom in
Europe, and many remote parts of Asia and Africa, given by Brand, I find
traces of it amongst the American tribes at the period of the Spanish
conquest. In 1542, when Hernando de Soto, the famous conquest-actor of
Florida, had an interview with the Cacique Guachoya, the following
curious incident occurred:&mdash;</p>


   <p class="blockquot">"In the midst of their conversation, the Cacique happened to
   sneeze. Upon this, all his attendants bowed their heads, opened
   and closed their arms; and making their signs of veneration,
   saluted their prince with various phrases of the same purport:
   'May the sun guard you,' 'may the sun be with you,' 'may the sun
   shine upon you,' 'defend you,' 'prosper you,' and the like; each
   uttered the phrase that came first to his mind, and for a short
   time there was a universal murmuring of these compliments."&mdash;

   vol. ii. p. 161.</p>


<p>Whence could the natives of the New World have derived a custom so
strikingly similar to that which the ancients record?</p>

<h4>
<span><i>Marlborough 5th November Custom</i>.</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;At Marlborough, Wiltshire, on the
5th of November, two or three years ago, I noticed a peculiar custom the
rustics have at their bonfires, to which I could attach no meaning; and
I did not, at the time, inquire of any person there regarding it.</p>

<p>They form themselves into a ring of some dozen or more round the
bonfire, and follow each other round it, holding thick club-sticks over
their shoulders; while a few others, standing at distances outside this
moving ring, with the same sort of sticks, beat those the men hold over
their shoulders, as they pass round in succession, all shouting and
screaming loudly. This might last half an hour at a time, and be
continued at intervals till the fire died out. Can any correspondent
inform me whether this <i>has</i> any meaning attached to it?</p>

<h4>
<span><i>Spectral Coach and Horses</i> </span>
<span>(Vol. iv., p. 195.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;A similar legend was
within a few years current near Bury St. Edmunds, in the same county,
where on Christmas Eve, at midnight, a coach drawn by four headless
horses, and driven by a headless coachman, might be seen to come in a
direction from the parish of Great Barton, across the fields, regardless
of fences, and proceed to a deep hole called "Phillis's Hole" near "the
two-mile spinney," in the parish of Rongham, and there find a
resting-place. A few years since, wishing to learn whether this sight
was among the things still looked for or believed in, I proceeded to the
locality at the time stated, but met with no one but a gamekeeper, whom
I found to be quite familiar with the legend. He said he had heard a
good deal in his younger days about the "coach," but had never seen it.
There was, however, an old woman then living who had seen it often, and
who declared that the coach was occupied by a gentleman and a lady, also
without heads, but he did not know what to say to it. All he knew was,
that when a man was out on dark nights, "he could draw anything into his
eye that he liked!"</p>

<h3>
<span>THE TREDESCANTS AND ELIAS ASHMOLE.</span>
</h3>

<p>Dr. Hamel, of whose memoir of the elder Tredescant and his voyage to
Russia I gave some account in Vol. iii., p. 391., being again in England
last year, pursued with unremitting zeal his researches into the history
of the Tredescants, and has given the results in a short Memoir read
before the Imperial Academy of Sciences at Petersburg on the 5th of
December last. Having been favoured with a copy of the memoir, and a
flattering letter from the writer, I think it incumbent upon me to add
to my former communication a brief abstract of this interesting paper.</p>

<p>Dr. Hamel first directed his researches toward an endeavour to develope
the means by which Elias Ashmole became the possessor of the Tredescant
collection; and naturally expected that he should be able to trace the
document of 1659, upon which Ashmole rested his claim to the ownership;
but he could not find any such deed.</p>

<p>He was, however, fortunate enough to trace out the original Will of John
Tredescant the younger, bearing his seal and signature, made at a
subsequent date, and formally proved, after his death in 1662, by his
widow Hester. This important document throws much light upon the
transaction respecting the Museum, and its destination. Dr. Hamel was
naturally much pleased with this discovery, and rejoiced to see for the
first time the autograph of a man about whom he had so much interested
himself, but was somewhat surprised to find that the name which has been
usually written Tr<i>a</i>descant was uniformly spelt Tr<i>e</i>descant in the
body of the Will, as well as in the signature; the seal, bearing the
same coat of arms given on a plate in the Catalogue of the Museum, being
placed between the syllable <i>Tre</i> and <i>descant</i>. This document runs
thus:</p>

  <p class="blockquot">   "THE LAST WILL AND TESTMANENT OF ME JOHN TREDESCANT.</p>

  <p class="blockquot">"In the name of God, Amen.</p>

   <p class="blockquot">"The fourth day of April in the yeare of our Lord God one

   defuncti et Executricis, etc."</p>

<p>It will be recollected that Ashmole, in his Diary, says&mdash;</p>

  <p class="blockquot">   "Decem. 12, 1659. Mr. Tredescant and his wife told me they had
   been long considering upon whom to bestow their close of
   curiosities when they died, and at last resolved to give it unto
   me."</p>

<p>Two days afterwards (on the 14th) they had given their scrivener
instructions to prepare a deed of gift to that effect, which was
executed by Tredescant, his wife being a subscribing witness on the
16th, as Ashmole records with astrological minuteness, "5 hor. 30
minutes post meridian." On May 30th, 1662, little more than a month
after John Tredescant's death, he records&mdash;</p>

  <p class="blockquot"> "This Easter term, I preferred a bill in Chancery against Mrs.
   Tredescant, for the rarities her husband had settled on me."</p>

<p>Dr. Hamel succeeded in finding the protocols in this suit among the
records of the Court of Chancery, in which Ashmole sets forth, that in
December, 1659, he visited the Tredescants in South Lambeth, and that he
was entertained by Tredescant and his wife with great professions of
kindness. That Mrs. Tredescant told him that her husband had come to the
determination to bequeath to him "the rarities and antiquities, bookes,
coynes, medalls, stones, pictures, and mechanicks contained in his
Closett of Raryties, knowing the great esteeme and value he put upon
it." That Tredescant himself had afterwards said to him, that in
acknowledgment of his (Ashmole's) previous trouble concerning the
preparation of the catalogue of his museum and gardens,<a id="gardens2"></a><a title="Go to footnote 2." href="#fn2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> he purposed
to do so, and that in effect Ashmole and Mrs. Tredescant, as long as she
lived, should enjoy it together. Ashmole also says, Tredescant had made
it a condition that he should, after Mrs. Tredescant's decease, pay a
certain Mary Edmonds, or her children, one hundred pounds sterling. That
he did then actually let a deed be prepared, by which he made over to
him his collection of every kind of curiosities of nature and art within
or near the house (Ashmole here cunningly includes the botanic garden);
Mrs. Tredescant was to have the joint proprietorship, and nothing was to
be abstracted from the collection.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="fn2"></a><a title="Return to text." href="#gardens2" class="label">[2]</a> In the preface to the catalogue the assistance of two
friends is mentioned; it appears that the other was Dr. Thomas Warton.</p>

<p>This deed Tredescant had, on the 16th of December (1659), confirmed
under his hand and seal. Mrs. Tredescant fetched a Queen Elizabeth's
milled shilling, which Tredescant handed over to him, together with the
conveyance, and thereby he came into possession of the collection.<a id="collection3"></a><a title="Go to footnote 3." href="#fn3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="fn3"></a><a title="Return to text." href="#collection3" class="label">[3]</a> Ashmole says, "It was not thought fit to clogge the deed
with the payment of the said hundred pounds to Mrs. Edmonds or her
children, to the end that the same might better appear to be a free and
generous gift, and therefore the consideracion of the deed was expressed
to be for the entire affeccion and singular esteeme the said John
Tredescant had to him (Ashmole), who he did not doubt would preserve and
augment the said rarities for posterity." He declares that he will pay
the money; and in his Diary we find that after Mrs. Tredescant's death,
in 1678, he pays to a Mrs. Lea, probably one of the daughters of Mrs.
Edmonds, one hundred pounds.</p>

<p>Mrs. Tredescant had signed the deed as witness; but, when Ashmole was
about to leave the house, she had requested him to leave it with her, as
she wished to ask some of her friends whether, by having signed it as
witness, her right as joint proprietress of the collection might not be
diminished. He left the document with her, in expectation that it would
soon be restored to him, but this was never done. Now, after the death
of Tredescant, she maintains that her husband never made such a
conveyance; but the truth is she has burnt or destroyed it in some other
manner.</p>

<p>Against this Mrs. Tredescant refers to her husband's last will and
testament of the 4th of May, 1661, by which all previous dispositions of
his property, of whatever kind, were declared invalid, and strongly
urges that the museum was expressly bequeathed to her and her alone,
with the stipulation that she should leave it either to the University
of Oxford or to that of Cambridge. And she adds, that she had determined
to leave it to the University of Oxford.</p>

<h4>
<span><i>Bothwell's Burial-place.</i></span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;Bothwell was imprisoned in Seeland, in the
castle of Draxholm,<a id="Page_369"></a> <span class="pagenum">[369]</span> now called Adelersborg, near the town of
Holbek. He died there, and was buried in the neighbouring village church
of Faareveile, where I in vain have searched for this tomb or coffin. An
old coffin, half opened, standing between several other old coffins in a
vault below the floor of the church, certainly was said, according to
tradition, to contain the body of Bothwell, but no inscriptions or other
signs proved the truth of it.</p>

<h4>
<span><i>Handel's Organ at the Foundling Hospital.</i></span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;It is generally understood
that the organ in the chapel of this Institution was the gift of Handel.
That great musician conducted a concert of sacred music upon the opening
of the chapel in 1749, and superintended the annual performance of his
oratorio, "The Messiah," from 1751 to 1759. In his will he left to the
charity "a fair copy of the score, and all its parts," of the same
oratorio; which score is still preserved, and has furnished the editor
of the new edition, lately produced by the Handel Society, with several
new and important readings.</p>

<p>Dr. Burney, in his "Sketch of the Life of Handel," prefixed to his
<i>Account of the Commemoration</i>, 4to., 1785, says, "The organ in the
chapel of this [<i>i.e.</i> the Foundling] hospital was a <i>present</i> from
Handel." But how are we to reconcile this statement with the following,
which I find in the <i>European Magazine</i> for February, 1799:</p>

   <p class="blockquot">"Handel <i>did not give</i> the organ to the Foundling Hospital. It
   was built at the <i>expense</i> of the charity, under the direction of
   Dr. Smith, the learned Master of Trinity College, Cambridge, who
   added demitones, &amp;c., and some of the niceties not occurring in
   other organs."</p>

<h4>
<span><i>Correction to the "Oxford Manual of Monumental Brasses.</i>"</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;Permit me to
correct an error in the above carefully compiled and useful manual. On
p. 15. of the "Descriptive Catalogue" a brass is described, No. 32. of
their collection, to "Edward Peach, 1439;" no place is mentioned in
connexion with this brass. The notice should stand thus:</p>

<p class="blockquot">"1839. Edward Peach, <i>S. Chad's (R.C.) Church, Birmingham</i>.</p>

   <i>milessimo</i> <span class="smaller"><i>D</i>CCCXXXIX</span>," &amp;c.</p>


<p>The brass is so well <i>designed</i> and <i>executed</i>, that it might easily
pass for an old example. By some error "s&#257;cte" has been printed for
"Beate," "millessimo" for "milessimo,"
 and "<span class="smaller">CCCC</span>" for
 "<span class="smaller">DCCC</span>" in the

<p>&mdash;In Vol. v., p. 275., mention is made of Cromwell's
skull; so it may not be out of place to tell you that I have handled one
of Milton's ribs. Cowper speaks indignantly of the desecration of our
divine poet's grave, on which shameful occurrence some of the bones were
clandestinely distributed. One fell to the lot of an old and esteemed
friend, and between forty-five and forty years ago, at his house, not
many miles from London, I have often examined the said rib-bone. That
friend is long since dead; but his son, now in the vale of years, lives,
and I doubt not, from the reverence felt to the great author of
<i>Paradise Lost</i>, that he has religiously preserved the precious relic.
It might not be agreeable to him to have his name published; but from
his tastes he, being a person of some distinction in literary pursuits,
is likely to be a reader of "N. &amp; Q.," and if this should catch his eye,
<i>he</i> may be induced to send you some particulars. I know he is able to
place the matter beyond a doubt.</p>

<h3>
<span>THE DANES IN ENGLAND.</span>
</h3>

<p>Since I arrived in England my friend Mr. Thoms has called my attention
to the following Note by the "English Opium Eater" in the <i>London
Magazine</i> for May, 1823, p. 556., on a subject of great interest to me
with reference to the views I have advanced in my recently published
volume, entitled <i>An Account of the Danes and Norwegians in England,
Scotland, and Ireland</i>.</p>

 <p class="blockquot">"I take this opportunity of mentioning a curious fact which I
   ascertained about twelve years ago, when studying the Danish. The
   English and Scotch philologists have generally asserted that the
   Danish invasions in the ninth and tenth centuries, and their
   settlements in various parts of the island (as Lincolnshire,
   Cumberland, &amp;c.), had left little or no traces of themselves in
   the language. This opinion has been lately reasserted in Dr.
   Murray's work on the European languages. It is, however,
   inaccurate. For the remarkable dialect spoken amongst the lakes
   of Cumberland and Westmoreland, together with the names of the
   mountains, tarns, &amp;c., most of which resist all attempts to
   unlock their meaning from the Anglo-Saxon, or any other form of
   the Teutonic, are pure Danish, generally intelligible from the
   modern Danish of this day, but in all cases from the elder form
   of the Danish. Whenever my Opera Omnia are collected, I shall
   reprint a little memoir on this subject, which I inserted about
   four years ago in a provincial newspaper: or possibly, before
   that event, for the amusement of the lake tourists, Mr.
   Wordsworth may do me the favour to accept it as an appendix to
   his work on the English Lakes."</p>

<p>Can any reader of "N. &amp; Q." refer me to the paper in which this "little
memoir" was inserted? (it was probably in a Cumberland or Westmoreland
paper somewhere about the year 1819;) or<a id="Page_370"></a> <span class="pagenum">[370]</span> inform me whether it
ever appeared as an appendix to any work of Wordsworth's on the English
lakes?</p>

<h4>
<span><i>Taylor Family.</i></span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;A great favour would be conferred by any
Worcestershire correspondent who could furnish any information as to the
family, arms, place of burial, of Samuel Taylor, who was Mayor of
Worcester in 1731-32, and again in 1737. Are any descendants or
connexions still resident in that neighbourhood? The information is
required for genealogical purposes.</p>

<h4>
<span><i>Analysis</i>.</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;Is algebra rightly termed analysis? Edgar Poe, a very queer
American author, maintains the negative: he also enters into the
question as to whether games of skill and chance are useful to the
analytical powers, and gives the preference to draughts over chess, and
to whist over either. But he seems to think the chief applications of
analysis are to the interpretation of cryptographies, the
disentanglement of police puzzles, and the solution of charades!</p>

<p>There is, however, plausibility in his theory that a good analyst must
be both poet and mathematician. This is Ruskin's "imagination
penetrative:" such a faculty belonged to the minds of Verulam and
Newton, of Kepler and Galileo. I do not, however, see the necessity of
Ruskin's threefold division of the "imaginative faculty." Would not
"imagination analytic and creative" suffice?</p>

<h4>
<span><i>Canongate Marriages.</i></span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;According to the <i>Newgate Calendar</i>, vol. ii. p.
269., there seems to have existed, about the year 1745, a sort of
<i>Gretna Green</i> in the Canongate of Edinburgh. It is long since I read
that <i>famous</i> work, but I made an excerpt at the time, which is as
follows:</p>

 <p class="blockquot"> "It was customary for some of the ministers of the Church of
   Scotland, who were out of employment, to marry people at the
   ale-houses, in the same manner that the Fleet marriages were
   conducted in London. Sometimes people of fortune thought it
   prudent to apply to these marriage brokers; but, as their chief
   business lay among the lower ranks of people, they were
   deridingly called by the name of 'Buckle the Beggars.' Most of
   these marriages were solemnized at public-houses in the
   Canongate."</p>

<p>This statement "comes in such a questionable shape," and from so
"questionable" a quarter, that really one cannot be blamed for
questioning it. Surely the ministers referred to must have been men
deprived of their charges? Can any correspondent of "N. &amp; Q." speak to
this subject? I am certain that the Scottish clergy of that age would
never have suffered any <i>Buckle the Beggars</i> to rank with them as
regular preachers, though "out of employment."</p>

<span><i>Devil, Proper Name.</i></span>

<p>&mdash;Will any of your correspondents kindly inform me
whether there are any persons now existing of the name of Devil; or who
bear the devil on their coat of arms? In 1847 I saw upon the panel of a
carriage in London the <i>devil's head</i> for a crest. To what family does

   Normandy, son of William the Conqueror, was surnamed 'the Devil.'
   In Norway and Sweden there were two families of the name of
   'Trolle,' in English, 'Devil;' and every branch of these families
   had an emblem of the devil for their coat of arms. In Utrecht
   there was a family called 'Teufel' (or Devil); and in Brittany
   there was a family of the name of 'Diable.'"</p>

<h3>
<span>ST. CHRISTOPHER.<br />
(Vol. v., p. 295.)</span>
</h3>

<p>Some years ago I remember meeting with the following explanation of the
beautiful legend of St. Christopher, and unfortunately forgot to take a
<i>Note</i> of it. It recurred to my mind on lately reading Mr. Talbot's work
on English etymologies, the writer of which appears to take a similar
view of the allegorical meaning.</p>

<p>Part of the legend is founded on the meaning of the Greek
<span title="[Greek: Christopherôn]">&#935;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#966;&#949;&#961;&#969;&#957;</span>, coupled with a circumstance in the original legend,
which is of German origin, and is an allegorizing of our blessed Lord's
bearing the sins of the world, and <i>offering</i> himself up on the altar of
the cross. In a Latin document of <span class="smaller">A.D</span>. 1423, the name is abbreviated
into <i>X'poferus</i>; in an English one of the same date it is spelt
<i>Christopfore</i>; and in French, <i>Christopfre</i>. <i>Christopfer</i> signifies
<i>Christ's sacrifice</i>: that is, the sacrifice of the cross continually
offered up in the sacrament of the altar, or the mass, the <i>messopfer</i>,
so named from the German <i>opfer</i>, a sacrifice; Welsh <i>offeiriad</i>, a
priest; <i>offrwm</i>, a sacrifice; <i>offeren</i>, the mass; Irish, <i>oifrionn</i>,
or <i>aifrionn</i>.</p>

<p>The perfection of our blessed Lord's humanity, His resistance of evil,
and mighty strength displayed in bearing the sins of the universe, are
shadowed out in the great stature and vast strength of the giant
Christopher. According to the legend, when he had succeeded in reaching
the shore, and had set down his burden, he said: "Chylde, thou hast put
me in grete peryll, thou wayest alle most as I had had the world upon
me; I might bere no greater burden;" and the child answered,
"Christopher, marvel thou nothing, for thou hast not only borne all the
world upon thee, but its sins likewise."<a id="Page_373"></a> <span class="pagenum">[373]</span></p>

<p>Mr. Talbot says, the name Christopher, <i>Christoffer</i>, may have been
given to children born on Good Friday, the day of the Great Sacrifice,
as those born on Christmas, Easter, and All Saints were named Pascal,
Noel, Toussaint.</p>

<h3>
<span>"REHETOUR" AND "MOKE," TWO OBSCURE WORDS USED BY WYCKLYFFE, A.D. 1384.<br />
(Vol. i., pp. 155. 278.)</span>
</h3>


<p>I. REHETOUR.</p>


 <p class="blockquot">  (See the <i>Three Treatises</i>, published by Dr. Todd, Dublin, 1851.
   Text, pages xxv, xxvi and lxv; Note on Rehetours, p. clxxi-ii.)</p>


<p>It is certain that Monastery and Minster were originally one word in
Latin; it is generally believed that Rhythm and Rhyme were one in Greek;
and it is possible that <i>Rehetour</i> and <i>Caterer</i> had one prototype in
Spanish: of this last pair only one survived; it is naturally that
which, by being equal to the other in sense, excels it in harmony with
the English tongue.</p>

<p>Convinced that the office assigned to the <i>Rehetours</i> in the lordly
household could not have been filled by any such character as ascribed
to the <i>Rehâteur</i>, <i>Reheater</i>, or <i>Rehaiteur</i>; convinced, moreover, that
the Scottish <i>Rehator</i>, <i>Rehatoure</i>, and the English <i>Rehetour</i> must be
either both restored to their common kindred, or else consigned to
common oblivion, I chose the former alternative; and after a careful
inquest held on these twin foundlings, together with <i>Rehete</i>,
<i>Reheting</i>, two other departed strangers of the same age, I venture to
pronounce the following verdict:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. A native of Spain, <i>Regatero</i> (see Stephen's <i>Spanish Dictionary</i>,
1726, and all that is said about <i>Regaton</i> in the <i>Diccionario</i> of the
Academy, Madrid, 1737, folio), travelling in Great Britain, changed to
<i>Rehetour</i>, <i>Rehator</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>2. By trade a retailer of provisions, huckster, or purveyor, his
character strongly partook of the nature of his commodities, so as to
become tainted; this appears from the quotations in Jamieson's <i>Etym.
Dictionary</i>, and is attested by the Spanish proverb, <i>Ni compres de
Regaton, ni te descuides en meson</i>: Wycklyffe in all three passages
expresses his apprehension of "harm." The French <i>regrattier</i> from
<i>gratter</i> (to scratch, scrape), and <i>Regatero</i>, <i>Regaton</i>,
 from <i>gato</i>
(a cat), whether they be, or be not, truly thus derived, bear equally
marks of a contemptible impression.</p>

<p>3. In Wycklyffe's simile the <i>Rehetours</i> take care of the bodily, the
ecclesiastics of the spiritual food, the Pope being the steward of the
household. The Scottish <i>Rehatour</i> we find no longer as an ordinary
plain dealer, but in a state of depravity, so as to be a mere byeword,
even in the sense of blackguard, which word itself, if we believe Nares
(see his <i>Glossary</i>) that it owes its existence to those menials of the
court, cannot have been barely "a jocular name," but their disposition
must have corresponded to their black exterior, otherwise the joke could
not have remained a lasting stigma. I believe, however, the word
<i>blackguard</i>, by inserting the <i>l</i>, merely simulates a vernacular
origin, it being properly <i>Beguards</i> (see Boiste, <i>Dictionnaire
Universel</i>), from <i>Beghardus</i> (see <i>Mediæval Glossaries</i>), once a German
participle <i>bek&#257;rt</i> (now <i>bekehrt</i>), <i>converted</i>, applied to the
Frater <i>conversus</i>, secular begging monks who, increasing in number and
misdeeds, soon became universally notorious, and ultimately (mixed up
with impostors who assumed their dress) would serve in any capacity
rather than the honest and irreproachable.</p>

<p>4. If <i>Caterer</i> proceeded from the Spanish, it arrived
thus&mdash;<i>Recatero</i>&mdash;<i>Recaterer</i>&mdash;<i>Caterer</i>;
 the <i>c</i> for <i>g</i> being either
the natural result from the accent which the majority of speakers
withdrew from the latter syllable of the word, or is accounted for by
"<i>Recatear lo mismo que regatear</i>:" the derivation from <i>re</i> and
<i>cautus</i>, as given by Covarrubias, likewise protects the <i>c</i>.</p>

<p>5. It is possible that the primitive root <i>Kat</i> or <i>Gat</i>, in the sense
of hollow, hole, cavity, cave, &amp;c., whence <i>Gate</i>, <i>Cot</i>, <i>Cottage</i>,
<i>Cattegat</i> (Sinus Codanus), probably also <i>Regatta</i>, was the first
element of both the Spanish and the English term; the spot or situation
where the eatables were originally exposed for sale thus causing them
first to be called <i>cates</i> (a plural noun like wages), then the singular
<i>cate</i>, &amp;c., the noun of agent having most probably preceded the verb
<i>cater</i>, which has come last. A similar derivation is certain with
regard to <i>huckster</i>, which, besides <i>huckeback</i>, joins the Swedish
<i>hökare</i>, German <i>Höker</i>, &amp;c., from the bending, crooked, or squatting
position in some brook or crook or corner.</p>

<p>6. The verb <i>Rehete</i> is aptly derived by Jamieson from <i>Rehaiter</i>; both
are extinct, yet their kindred <i>heiter</i> (formerly <i>haiter</i>), with its
two verbs <i>erheitern</i> and <i>aufheitern</i>, are still in full vigour among
the Germans, to whom they afford serenity of mind, mood, and weather.
The French compound word for wishing, <i>souhaiter</i>, refers its verb
<i>haiter</i> to the Swedish <i>heta</i>, German <i>heissen</i>,
 Anglo-Saxon <i>hetan</i>,
as in <i>Ulf het aræran cyrice</i>, "U<span class="smcap lowercase">LF</span> bid rear the church" (see Latham,
<i>Engl. Lang.</i> 1850, p. 99.): now if also from the <i>haiter</i> of that
compound we may suppose a derivative <i>Rehaiter</i>, or at least one of the
kind to have served Chaucer in his participle <i>Reheting</i>, which has been
the puzzle of his commentators in the following passage from <i>Troilus</i>
(III. line 350.):</p>

<div class="poem">

    <p>  "And all the reheting of his sikes (sighs) sore,</p>
     <p> At ones fled, he felt 'hem no more;"</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">we may easily understand thereby that, as it were, a rebidding, an
importunate insisting upon, the<a id="Page_374"></a> <span class="pagenum">[374]</span> repetition of his sighs, ceased
and were at an end; so that in the time of Edward III. a person
complaining of a troublesome cough, headache, &amp;c., might call it a
reheting cough, &amp;c.</p>



<p>II. MOKE.</p>

<p class="blockquot">(See the said <i>Three Treatises</i>, pages cxxxvii, and Notes, pages
   ccxx. ccxxiii-iv.)</p>


<p>Wyckliffe using the possessive "<i>their moke</i>," not the mere "a," as we
would say, I would not give "a pin," "a button," &amp;c., together with the
evidence of the Irish <i>muc</i>, and the obsolete German <i>Mocke</i>, which has
been defined "Sus f&oelig;minea, quæ ob f&oelig;tus alitur," hardly leaves a
doubt that he means that animal, which may be traced also in the words
<i>muck</i>, <i>mucky</i>, &amp;c. The reader may judge for himself by the following
passage:&mdash;</p>

  <p class="blockquot"> "Crist gave his life for hise brether, and so rewled hise shepe;
   thei wolen not <i>gyue her moke</i> to help <i>here</i> nedy brethern, but
   leten <i>here shep</i> perishen, and taken of hem."</p>


<p>In allusion to their not feeding their flock, but suffering their sheep
to perish, he prefers to mention an eatable object.</p>

  <p class="blockquot"> [M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. B<span class="smcap lowercase">ENMOHEL</span> is wrong in supposing
 the word <i>Beghard</i> to signify

   of their superabundant merits; and, being clothed at his death in
   the habit of the order, was a <i>frater conversus</i>. Another class

<p class="blockquot">The <i>Beghards</i>, on the other hand, were not, properly speaking,
   monks at all, inasmuch as they were not under any monastic vow.
   They professed poverty, and lived on alms generally; but in other
   respects their mode of life was various, and their orthodoxy and
   morality very doubtful. They are generally denounced by the
   ecclesiastical authorities; and, except in some few places and
   under certain regulations, were never recognised by the Church.
   The best account of them will be found in Mosheim's posthumous
   and unfinished treatise, <i>De Beghardis et Beguinis</i>. The name is
   evidently, as Mosheim shows, a compound of <i>beg</i> (from the old
   Saxon <i>beggen</i>, mendicare) and <i>hard</i>, or <i>hart</i>, a servant,
   famulus, servus: the same word which we still use in the
   composition of such words as shepherd, cow-herd, swine-herd. So
   that <i>Beghard</i> is not otherwise different from our word <i>beggar</i>,
   than in so far as it was formerly applied to a religious sect.</p>

<p class="blockquot">M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. B<span class="smcap lowercase">ENMOHEL'S</span> explanation of <i>Rehetour</i> is very ingenious, and
   may very possibly be true. His interpretation of <i>Muck</i> is not so
   satisfactory.]</p>




<h3>
<span>PLAGUE STONES.<br />
(Vol. v., p. 226.)</span>
</h3>

<p>At the bottom of a street leading from Bury St. Edmunds to the Newmarket
road, stands an octagonal stone of Petworth marble with a hole in it,
which is said to have been filled with water or vinegar in the time of
the small-pox in 1677, for people to dip their money in on leaving the
market. What truth may attach to the traditionary use of the stone I
know not; but the stone is the base of a cross called St. Peter's Cross,
and the hole is the socket for the shaft.</p>

  <p class="right">B<span class="smcap lowercase">URIENSIS</span>.</p>


<p>Are the stones mentioned by your correspondent J. J. S. as plague stones
anything more than the "holy stones" common at the meeting of old cross
roads in Lancashire, and perhaps other counties? The square hole in them
is surely nothing more than the socket in which the way-side cross was
formerly placed. Perhaps, however, he is speaking of a different and
less common kind of stone, in which case, if a list is made, it must be
by some competent person, able to distinguish the one from the other.</p>

<p class="right"> P. P.</p>


<p>In compliance with the suggestion of J. J. S., I may note that what I
suppose (since reading his communication in "N. &amp; Q.") to be a "plague
stone" is to be seen close to Gresford in Denbighshire. I met with it
last summer, and could not then imagine what it could be. It is a large
hexagonal (I think) stone, with a round cavity on the top, which
certainly was full of water when I passed it. This cavity is pretty
deep, and the stone must be nearly three feet high, by from two to three
across. I regret I made no measurements of it. It is situated about a
quarter of a mile from the town on the road to Wrexham, under a
wide-spreading tree, on an open space where three roads meet. Should
this be seen by any Gresfordite, perhaps he would send you a more
accurate description of this stone, with any legend that may be attached
to it.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding his name, which appears to indicate northern origin,
your correspondent W. F<span class="smcap lowercase">RASER</span> may possibly be unacquainted with Robert

<div class="poem">

      <p>"Sutton Long, Sutton Long, at every door a tump of dung.</p>

<p>It was an ancient saying in the parish, and I believe the word <i>tump</i> is
Somersetshire for heap.</p>

<p>A village in Essex, called Ugley, possesses the unfortunate saying:</p>

<h4>
<span><i>Provincial Words.</i></span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;Though the Rev. Wm. Barnes has almost
perfectionated the catalogue of Dorset provincialisms in the Glossary to
his beautiful poems in the Dorset dialect, I still sometimes meet with a
stray omission, viz.:</p>

<div class="poem">

      <p><i>Clean-sheaf.</i> Altogether, <i>e.g.</i> "I've clean-sheaf vargot."</p>

<p>In connexion with this inquiry, would it not be interesting to make out
a list of proper names of individuals, the pronunciation of which is
different from the spelling; and, if possible, to trace (for example)

<h4>
<span><i>The Word "Pick."</i></span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;Presuming that the proposal at Vol. v., p. 173.,
involves the discussion and illustration of the words inserted, allow
me, as a Lancashire man, to express my belief that the word <i>pick</i> has
invariably the sense of "to throw," and not "to push." It is in fact
another form of the verb "to pitch;" the two terminations being almost
convertible, especially in words formed from the Saxon, as "fetch" from
"feccean," "stitch" from "stician," "thatch" from "theccan," the earlier
form of the latter word being retained in the well-known lines of "Bessy
Bell and Mary Gray." <i>Pick</i>, in the sense of "throw," will be found in
Shakspeare's <i>Henry VIII.</i>, Act V. Sc. 3.:</p>

<div class="poem">

     <p> "I'll <i>pick</i> you o'er the pales."</p>

</div>

<p>And in <i>Coriolanus</i>, Act I. Sc. 1.:</p>

<div class="poem">

    <p>  "As high as I could <i>pick</i> my lance."</p>

</div>

<p>And see the notes of the various commentators on these passages. If the
subject be worth further illustration, I may mention that in the
district of the cotton manufacture, the instrument by which the shuttle
is <i>thrown</i> across the loom is called a <i>picker</i>; and each thread of the
woven fabric, being the result of one throw of the shuttle, is, by using
the word in a secondary sense, called a <i>pick</i>. I have heard a story of
a worthy patron of the Arts, more noted for his wealth than his taste,
who, attributing certain freedom of touch in a picture, for which he had
given a commission, to a want of due pains in elaboration, expressed his
dissatisfaction by saying, "there were not the right number of <i>picks</i>
to the inch;" the threads of calico, when received from the weaver,
being usually counted under the microscope as a test of the goodness of
the work.</p>

<h3>
<span>LONDON STREET CHARACTERS.<br />
(Vol. v., p. 270.)</span>
</h3>


<p>I believe more than one of the courts to be haunted by persons who may
have suggested Mr. Dickens's "Little Old Lady." More than twenty years
ago a female of about fifty was a constant attendant on the Court of
Queen's Bench in Banco: I never saw her at a Nisi Prius sitting. She was
meanly but tidily dressed, quiet and unobtrusive in manners, but much
gratified by notice from any barrister. It was said she had been ruined
by a suit, but I could not learn anything authentic about her; though I
several times spoke and listened to her, partly from curiosity and
partly from the pleasure which she showed at being spoken to. Her
thoughts seemed fixed upon the business of the day, and I never
extracted more than, "Will they take motions?&mdash;Will <i>it</i> come on
next?&mdash;I hope he will bring it on to-day!" but who was "he," or what was
"it," I could not learn; and when I asked, she would pause as if to
think, and pointing to the bench, say, "That's Lord Tenterden." I have
seen her rise, as about to address the court, when the judges were going
out, and look mortified as if she felt neglected. I cannot say when she
disappeared, but I do not remember having seen her for the last eight
years.</p>

<p>I have heard that an old woman frequented Doctors' Commons about seven
years ago. She appeared to listen to the arguments, but was reserved and
mopish, if spoken to. She often threw herself in the way of one of the
leading advocates, and always addressed him in the same words: "Dr.
&mdash;&mdash;, I am <i>virgo intacta</i>."</p>

<p>The sailor-looking man described by Charles Lamb lasted a long time. I
remember him in Fleet Street and the Strand when I was boy, and also an
account which appeared in the newspapers of his vigorous resistance when
apprehended as a vagrant; but I cannot fix the dates. I think, however,
it was about 1822. His portrait is in Kirby's <i>Wonderful and Eccentric
Museum</i>, vol. i. p. 331. Below it is, "Samuel Horsey, aged fifty-five, a
singular beggar in the streets of London." The date of the engraving is
August 30, 1803. As the accompanying letter-press is not long, I copy
it:</p>

   <p class="blockquot">"This person, who has so long past, that is to say, during
   nineteen years, attracted the notice of the public, by the
   severity of his misfortunes, in the loss of both his legs, and
   the singular means by which he removes himself from place to
   place, by the help of a wooden seat constructed in the manner of
   a rocking-horse, and assisted by a pair of crutches, first met
   with his calamity by the falling of a piece of timber from a
   house at the lower end of Bow Lane, Cheapside. He is now
   fifty-five years of age, and commonly called the King of the
   Beggars: and as he is very corpulent, the facility he moves with
   is very singular. From his general appearance and complexion, he
   seems to enjoy a state of health remarkably good. The frequent
   obtrusion of a man naturally stout and well made, but now so
   miserably mutilated as he is, having excited the curiosity of
   great numbers of people daily passing through the most crowded
   thoroughfares of the metropolis, has been the leading motive of
   this account, and the striking representation of his person here
   given."</p>


<p>The likeness is very good. Among the stories told of him, one was that
his ample earnings enabled him to keep two wives, and, what is more, to
keep them from quarrelling. He presided in the evenings at a "cadgers'
club," planted at the head of the table, with a wife on each side. Not
having been present at these meetings I do not ask anybody to believe
this report.</p>

<p class="right">  H. B. C.</p>

<p class="left"> U. U. Club.</p>


<p>I believe Mr. Dickens's sketch, in the <i>Bleak House</i>, of the woman who
haunts the various Inns of Court, to be a clever combination of
different real characters. It is principally taken from a stout painted
old woman, long since dead, and who I believe was really ruined by some
suit in Chancery, and went mad in consequence, and used to linger about
the Courts, expecting some judgment to be given in her favour. Mr.
Dickens seems to have combined this woman's painful history with the
person and appearance of the diminutive creature mentioned by
 M<span class="smcap lowercase">R.</span> A<span class="smcap lowercase">LFRED</span> G<span class="smcap lowercase">ATTY</span>. This latter personage is the daughter of a man for many years
bedmaker in one of the Inns of Court (I think Gray's Inn), and much of
her eccentricity is assumed, as, when begging from the few lawyers who
are old enough to remember her father as their bedmaker, no one is more
rational and collected. Though this little woman is well known from her
singular appearance and demeanour, there is no romance about her
history, and her craziness (if it really exists) is not to be attributed
to the Court of Chancery,&mdash;at which, as it is in the position of the
dying lion in<a id="Page_377"></a> <span class="pagenum">[377]</span> the fable, every donkey (I mean no disrespect to
Mr. Dickens) must have its fling.</p>

<p>If any correspondent really feels an interest in this little creature's
history, I can undertake, with very little trouble, to supply the
fullest particulars.</p>

<p class="right">B. N. C.</p>

<p class="left">Oxford.</p>

<p>Although I have for many years ceased to be an inhabitant of the
metropolis, I am much gratified at the suggested record of these
worthies, and think it would be a most interesting book, were truthful
particulars got together concerning them, with good portraits&mdash;I mean
striking likenesses&mdash;of these beings, who, as A<span class="smcap lowercase">LFRED</span> G<span class="smcap lowercase">ATTY</span> observes,
"come like shadows, so depart." I will inform him something about the
"half-giant," of whom Charles Lamb says, that he "was brought low during
the riots of London." I almost doubt this, for just about then he lived
in the parish of St. Mary-le-Strand; indeed, before then, my grandfather
was there overseer, or otherwise a parochial authority, and he had him
apprehended and imprisoned as a rogue and a vagabond. I have often heard
my father talk about him; indeed, he knew this man well, and I regret
that I have forgotten his name. He always spoke of him as having been <i>a
sailor</i>, and that he had his legs carried away by a cannon-ball. This
burly beggar had two daughters, to each of whom he is said to have given
500<i>l.</i> on her wedding; and it was also said he left a handsome sum of
money at his death. But, doubtless, some curious correspondent will be
able to forward the desideratum with farther information. I only tell
the little I know.</p>

<p>The old porter, John, at the King's printing-office, whom I remember as
quite a character, "N. &amp; Q." have peculiar facilities to immortalise. We
sexagenarians all remember the blackee at the crossing by Waithman's in
Bridge Street. He was said to have died very rich, and reported to have
sold his "walk," when he retired from business, for 1000<i>l.</i></p>

<p>But other "characters" might amusingly be introduced, such as those two
or three last roses in summer who continue to wear pig-tails or
pantaloons. I would even not omit Baron Maseres, and such
peculiarities&mdash;the German with his Bible and beard, without
 a hat&mdash;<i>et hoc genus omne</i>. There is a large work of the kind, exhibiting portraits
and biographies of these illustrious personages in Edinburgh; it is now
scarce and valuable. I remember spending a most interesting evening over
it with a Scotchman, who knew and described many of the characters
developed.</p>

<h3>
<span>STONE PILLAR WORSHIP.<br />
(Vol. v., p. 121.)</span>
</h3>


<p>S<span class="smcap lowercase">IR</span> J. E<span class="smcap lowercase">MERSON</span> T<span class="smcap lowercase">ENNENT</span> has accumulated many interesting particulars, but
by no means exhausted the subject. O'Brien, in his <i>Essay on the Round
Towers</i>, advocates the opinion of their being idolatrous
objects&mdash;remnants of Buddhism. The <i>Lia fail</i> is celebrated in Irish
history. The episcopal city of Elphin has its name from a celebrated
pillar stone, which remained erect until Charles II.'s time, when it
fell in accordance with an ancient prophecy. This is attested by the
cotemporary evidence of O'Flaherty. Clogher has its name from another
celebrated stone, designated "The Golden Stone," which I believe was
oracular. There was in the city of Dublin, until recently, a curious
remnant of this veneration for stones, and in which we could probably
trace the transition from the Pagan to the Christian usage. At the base
of the tower of St. Audoen's Church was a rude-looking stone, something
like a spud-post, let into the wall, but so as to abut upon the street.
On the upper part of this stone was carved a cross in very low relief.
The stone was designated "The Lucky Stone," and the lower classes of the
people, especially hawkers and itinerant vendors of small wares,
believed that their success in business depended on their making a daily
visit to this stone, which they kissed; and thus a portion of the stone
became perfectly smooth and polished. There was a tradition, too, that
whenever the stone was removed, it was miraculously conveyed back to its
place. Thus it was said to have been stolen away to Galway, but to have
been restored to its original site on the following day. However this
may be, it remained attached to the church tower until about the year
1828, when some alterations being made in the church, it disappeared
from its place. The belief was, that one of the churchwardens, a man in
trade, had removed the stone into his own place of business, with a view
of engrossing all the luck to himself. Whether he succeeded or not, I do
not know; but after an interval of twenty years the identical stone
reappeared in front of a large Roman Catholic chapel lately erected near
St. Audoen's Church. It remained there, a conspicuous and
well-remembered object, near the donation-box, which it perhaps
assisted; but about six months ago it again disappeared, having been
removed, I know not where.</p>

<h3>
<span>ON A PASSAGE IN HAMLET, ACT I. SC. 4.<br />
(Vol. v., p. 169.)</span>
</h3>

<p>Theobald long since observed&mdash;</p>

   <p class="blockquot">"I do not remember a passage throughout our poet's works more
   intricate and depraved in the text, of less meaning to outward
   appearance, or more likely to baffle the attempt of criticism in
   its aid."<a id="Page_378"></a> <span class="pagenum">[378]</span></p>




<p>He then proposes his reading:</p>

<div class="poem">

                      <p class="i5">"The dram of <i>base</i></p>
      <p>Doth all the noble substance of <i>worth out</i></p>
      <p>To his own scandal;"</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">observing that "the dram of base" means the <i>alloy</i> of baseness or vice,
and that it is frequent with our poet to use the <i>adjective of quality</i>
instead of the substantive signifying the thing.</p>

<p>It would be tedious to enumerate all the hapless attempts at emendation
which have been subsequently made, but I must be allowed to refer to
that adopted by M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. S<span class="smcap lowercase">INGER</span> as long since as the year 1826, when he
vindicated the original reading, <i>doubt</i>, from the unnecessary meddling
of Steevens and Malone. M<span class="smcap lowercase">R.</span> S<span class="smcap lowercase">INGER</span> thus printed the passage:</p>

<div class="poem">

                   <p class="i5"> "The dram of <i>bale</i></p>
  <p>    Doth all the noble substance <i>often</i> doubt,</p>
    <p>  To his own scandal."</p>

</div>

<p><i>Bale</i> was most probably preferred to <i>base</i> as more euphonous, and
nearer to the word <i>eale</i> in the <i>first</i> quarto; but M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. S. would now
perhaps adopt <i>base</i>, as suggested by the word <i>ease</i>, in
 the <i>second</i>
quarto, for the reasons given by Theobald and your correspondent A. E.
B.</p>

<p>It is evident that <i>dout</i> cannot have been the poet's word, for, as your
correspondent remarks, the meaning is obviously, that "the dram of base"
renders all the noble substance doubtful or suspicious, not that it
extinguishes it altogether. This will appear from what precedes:</p>

<div class="poem">

      <p>"Or by some habit that too much <i>o'erleavens</i></p>
     <p> The form of plausive manners," &amp;c.</p>

</div>

<p>Under present impressions, therefore, I should prefer, as the least

<p class="noindent">i.e. <i>doth cast a doubt over</i> all the noble substance, <i>bring into
suspect</i> all the noble qualities by the leaven of one dram of baseness.
This, according to your correspondent's own showing, is the very sense
required by the context, "the base <i>doth</i> doubt to the noble, i.e.
<i>imparts</i> doubt to it, or renders it doubtful." And when we recollect
the frequent use of the elision <i>o'er</i> for <i>over</i> by the poet, and the
ease with which <i>of</i> might be substituted for it by the compositor, I
cannot but think it conclusive. To me the proposed reading, "<i>offer</i>
doubt," does not convey a meaning quite so clear and unequivocal.</p>

<p>Conjectural emendation of the text of our great poet is always to be
made with extreme caution, and that reading which will afford a clear
sense, with the slightest deviation from the first editions, is always
to be preferred. The errors are chiefly typographical, and often clearly

<h3>
<span>"THE MAN IN THE ALMANACK."<br />
(Vol. v., p. 320.)</span>
</h3>

<p>Nat Lee's <i>Man i' th' Almanack stuck with Pins</i> has no reference to
"pricking for fortunes;" but to the figure of a man surrounded by the
signs of the zodiac found in old almanacks, and intended to indicate the
favourable, adverse, or indifferent periods for bloodletting. From the
various signs are <i>lines</i> drawn to various parts of the naked figure;
and these lines give it very much the appearance of being <i>stuck with
pins</i>.</p>

<p>I have not ready access to any old English almanacks; but a German one
of the early part of the sixteenth century contained the figure as above
described, with this inscription:</p>

<div class="poem">

      <p>"In dieser Figur sihet man in welchem</p>
      <p>Zeichen güt, mittel, oder böss lassen sey."</p>

</div>

<p>Surrounding the frame, the words "güt," "mittel," or "böss" are placed
against each sign of the zodiac from which the lines are drawn; and
underneath the figure are the following verses:</p>

<div class="poem">

     <p> "Im Glentz und in des Sommers zeit,</p>
     <p> So lass du auff der rechten seyt,</p>
  <p>    In Winters zeit, und in dem Herbst,</p>
      <p>Auff der lincken;&mdash;dass du nit sterbst."</p>

</div>

<p>Some former possessor has written on the margin:</p>

<div class="poem">

    <p>  "Signa c&oelig;li sunt 12. sq<span class="topnum">r</span>:</p>

   <p>   "Quatuor <i>boni</i>: Aries, Libra, Sagittarius, et Aquarius.</p>

    <p>  "Et etiam quatuor <i>medii</i>, sq<span class="topnum">r</span>.: Cancro, Virgo,
      Scorpio, et Pisces.</p>

   <p>   "Et quatuor <i>mali</i>: Geminij, Leo, Capricornus et
      Taurus."</p>

</div>

<p>Similar figures no doubt occur in our old English almanacks. I will
merely add that the figure above described is pasted on the back of the
title-page of an edition of <i>Regimen Sanitatis</i>, with an interlineary
version in German verse, bearing the following imprint: "Impressum
Auguste per Johannem Froschauer, Anno D<span class="topnum">m&#773;</span>
<span class="smaller"> MD</span>ij." 4to.</p>

<p>The book also bears a German title which, as it mentions the subject of
bloodletting [lassen], I may as well transcribe: ¶ <i>Diss ist das
Regiment der Gesuntheyt durch all monat des ganzen iars, wie man sich
halten sol mit essen und trincken, und auch von lassen.</i> I presume that
the rules for bloodletting which accompany the old almanacks are chiefly
derived from this <i>Regimen Sanitatis</i>, which is founded upon that of the
school of Salerno, as they form a principal feature in its
precepts.<a id="Page_379"></a> <span class="pagenum">[379]</span></p>

<p>This edition of the book does not appear to have been known to Sir
Alexander Croke: I will therefore give the general precepts for the
twelve months which are prefixed to it.</p>

<p>Such were the popular dietetics, and the almanacks were made the vehicle
of communicating them. As late as the year 1659, Edmund Gayton, author
of the <i>Festivous Notes on Don Quixote</i>, put forth a book in verse
entitled <i>The Art of Longevity, or a Dietetical Institution</i>. He had
graduated in physic at Oxford, but in his book he plays the part of a
Merry Andrew more than that of a physician. The book, however, is
curious as well as rare.</p>

<h3>
<span>EPIGRAM ON DR. FELL.<br />
(Vol. v., pp. 296. 333.)</span>
</h3>


<p>Your correspondent E. F. may very probably have been informed, by ladies
intimate with the Sheridan family, that Tom Sheridan composed the lines
on Dr. Fell, respecting whose author and subject inquiries were made by
a querist in page 296.; but it is nevertheless quite untrue. My memory
of those lines goes back to a date earlier than Tom Sheridan's capacity
for writing an epigram; and this on Dr. Fell may be found, if memory
does not deceive me, in the <i>Elegant Extracts in Verse</i>, of a date at
least as early as Tom Sheridan's work. The subject of the epigram was
Dr. Fell, who held the deanery of Christ Church with the bishopric of
Oxford, in the times of Charles II. and James II. Its author probably
put it into circulation anonymously, as is usual with such brief
specimens of personal satire.</p>

<p>As lodged in my memory, the third line was,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">

  <p> "But this I'm sure I know full well."</p>

</div>

<p>That Dr. Fell, with some learning and a character for loyalty, had
somewhat in him which a discerning observer could not like, is become
notorious since the publication of his correspondence with the
obsequious and unprincipled Earl of Sunderland respecting Locke, whom
James II. wished the Dean to deprive of the income he received as a
student of Christ Church. (See Appendix to <i>Fox's History of Early Part
of Reign of James II.</i>) Dr. Fell there tells the Earl that he had long
watched Mr. Locke, and made "strict inquiries," but that no person had
ever heard him speak a word against the government. He adds, that
language disparaging Locke's political friends had frequently been used
for the treacherous purpose of provoking such replies as might have been
used to his ruin, but hitherto all in vain; and that, as he had
withdrawn to the Continent, some other plan must now be adopted. He
accordingly proposes a mode of ensnaring him, subjoining, that if the
King would simply order his expulsion, the mandate should be obeyed,
without asking for any proof of his deserving such a sentence. This was
accordingly done; but in two short years the circumstances of all the
parties were changed. The Bishop and Dean was gone to appear before Him
who has said, "Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment;" the King had
withdrawn to the Continent, expelled by his own terrors, and deprived of
his inheritance; Locke was returning to his native land, to be counted
one of its chief ornaments; the Earl of Sunderland had betrayed his
master, and was desiring to be allowed to do any dirty work for another.</p>

which my library afforded, and made the following notes. P. T. had<a id="Page_380"></a> <span class="pagenum">[380]</span>
not found the semicolon earlier than 1636, with the exception of
Gerard's <i>Herbal</i>, 1597. It is, however, probable that the communication
of A. J. H. (p. 164.), by which it appears that the semicolon was used
in 1585, may render my notes of no use. However, I send my contribution,
such as it is.</p>

<p>In an edition of Latimer's <i>Sermons</i>, small 4to., black letter, judged
to be the edition of 1584, the stop in question is not found. The note
of interrogation is very curiously formed,&mdash;a colon surmounted by a
comma, thus [,:] I might also observe that, to one of such limited
knowledge as myself, the paging is singular,&mdash;only one numeral on each
leaf.</p>

<p>In <i>Caroli Sigonii de Republica Hebræorum</i>, libri vij, Hanoviæ, 1608, no
semicolon occurs. But in Purchas' <i>Pilgrimage</i>, 1613, all the four stops
are used. So also in <i>The Spanish Mandevile of Myracles</i>, 1618.</p>

<h4>
<span><i>Absalom's Hair</i> </span>
<span>(Vol. iv., pp. 131. 243.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;In answer to P. P., who
says that "Absalom's long hair had nothing to do with his death, his
head itself, and not the hair upon it, having been caught in the boughs
of the tree," R<span class="smcap lowercase">T</span>. refers to the "respectable antiquity" of the popular
tradition. In the Vulgate edition of the Bible (Venetiis, 1760, ex
Typographia Balleoniana) there is a rude woodcut, evidently of much
older date than 1760, in which Absalom is represented as hanging by his
hair. Perhaps some of your correspondents can mention similar woodcuts
of a far earlier date.</p>

<p>In a family Bible (black letter, 1634), I find the following MS. note on
2 Sam. xiv. 26.: "And when he polled his head ... he weighed the hair of
his head at two hundred shekels after the king's weight;" which suggests
a solution of the difficulty which has puzzled many commentators, who,
to make Absalom's hair of the full weight, have to suppose that it was
plastered with pomatum and sprinkled with gold dust:</p>

  <p class="blockquot"> "Y<span class="topnum">e</span> lesser shekel weighed a
 quarter of an ounce, y<span class="topnum">e</span> greater
   half an ounce. We cannot therefore
 suppose y<span class="topnum">t</span> y<span class="topnum">e</span> loppings of
   Absalom's hair weighed either 50 or 100 oz.
But y<span class="topnum">t</span> w<span class="topnum">n</span> it was
   cut off his serv<span class="topnum">ts</span> might have
sold it for 12<span class="topnum">lb</span> 10<span class="topnum">s</span> or
   25<span class="topnum">lb</span> to y<span class="topnum">e</span>
Ladys of Jerusalem, who were ambitious of adorning
   y<span class="topnum">r</span> heads w<span class="topnum">th</span>
 y<span class="topnum">e</span> Hair of y<span class="topnum">e</span> beautifull
 Absalom: w<span class="topnum">th</span> y<span class="topnum">e</span>
   locks of y<span class="topnum">e</span> K<span class="topnum">s</span> son...."</p>

<p>It is recorded that when Absalom was buried "they laid a very great heap
of stones on him." Was this in detestation and abhorrence (cf. Joshua
vii. 26., viii. 29.), or in honourable memory of a prince and chief? If
the former, did it give rise to the custom of flinging stones in the
graves of malefactors?</p>

<span><i>The Countess of Desmond</i></span>
<span> (Vol. v., p. 323.).</span>

<p>&mdash;Having succeeded in
eliciting notices of various pictures of Oliver Cromwell attributed to
Cooper, without discovering the original miniature bequeathed to Richard
Burke by Sir Joshua Reynolds, I am tempted to mention that I once saw a
portrait of the Countess of Desmond, hitherto not described by any of
her biographers, but very much resembling the Windsor picture and
Penant's engraved print, though evidently the work of an inferior
artist. The portrait in question was a short time in my father's
possession, soon after the year 1800, having been delivered to him by
the executor of Mrs. Elizabeth Berkeley, an eccentric old lady, well
known as a correspondent of the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i>, who left the
picture, with many others, to Lord Braybrooke. But it was soon claimed
by a Mr. Grimston of Sculcoates, in Yorkshire, who seemed to be entitled
to a great portion of the collection, and my father was glad to be
allowed to retain two fine views of Venice, painted by Canaletti for
Berkeley, Bishop of Cloyne, who was the father of Mrs. Berkeley's
husband, and which are still at Audley End. Perhaps this statement made
from memory at the end of fifty years may be of no value, but it shows
the existence of another likeness of the person always described as the
Countess of Desmond, and as it came originally from the collection of an
Irish prelate, it probably, like the lady herself, belonged to the
Emerald Isle.</p>

<p>&mdash;In an old annual

of the marriage of Mrs. Claypole. I think it gives the date required by
B. N., but the phraseology is rather old-fashioned, and may be open to a
second interpretation. I send you the extract entire:&mdash;</p>

   <p class="blockquot">"Elizabeth (and not Mary, as stated in your note) became the wife
   of John Claypole, Esquire, of Northamptonshire, made Master of

Tottenham Church. He was a baron from 1631 till his death in 1638.</p>

<p>The authors describe him as "son of Thomas of the Inner Temple, London,
son of Richard Crawford, in the county of Northampton, son of Thomas of
Barton Seagrave, &amp;c., in the said county." He married three wives: 1.
Katherine, daughter of Dr. Lewin, Dean of the Arches; 2. Bridget,
daughter of Anthony Bowyer; and 3. Margaret, daughter of Robert Harris
of Lincoln's Inn. The latter we find, in Ashmole's <i>Antiquities of
Berks</i>, vol. iii. p. 88., had been married twice before, and that her
father was of Reading.</p>

<p>Baron Paget had no children by his last two wives; but by his first,
besides two daughters, he had two sons: Justinian of Hadley, Middlesex,
<i>custos brevium</i> of the Court of King's Bench; and Thomas.</p>

<h4>
<span><i>Mary Queen of Scots and Bothwell's Confession</i> </span>
<span>(Vol. iv., p. 313.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;Æ<span class="smcap lowercase">GROTUS</span> refers, I presume, to a document which he will find in a
little volume entitled, <i>Les Affaires du Comte de Bodnée</i>, published at
Edinburgh by the Bannatyne Club in<a id="Page_382"></a> <span class="pagenum">[382]</span> 1829. The narrative was
written in the old French, at Copenhagen. The original is still
preserved in the Royal Library of the Castle of Drottningholm in Sweden.
Bothwell wrote it on "la vielle des Roys," 1568, and appears to have
given it to the Chevalier de Dauzay, the French ambassador, to be
communicated to the King of Denmark. Dauzay received it on the 13th of
January, 1568, and placed it before the ministers of the King on the
16th of January. M. Mignet, in his history, throws discredit on this
confession, styling it "a very adroit narrative" (<i>L'Histoire de Marie
Stuart</i>, vol. i. appendix H.); though such a self-crimination, at such a
time, would seem to any impartial mind to weigh strongly in favour of
the ill-fated young queen, whose character it tends to exculpate.</p>

<h4>
<span><i>Introduction of Glass into England</i></span>
<span> (Vol. v., p. 322.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;It is
impossible to determine at what period the use of glass utensils for
domestic purposes was first introduced into this country; but being
manufactured by the Egyptians and Ph&oelig;nicians, we may very probably
owe the introduction of it to them. Window glass appears to have been
used in the churches of France as early as the sixth century; and
according to Bede, artificers skilled in the art of glass-making were
invited into England by Abbot Benedict in the seventh century; and the
churches or monasteries of Wearmouth and Garrow were glazed and adorned
by his care. Wilfrid, Bishop of Worcester, about the same time took
similar steps for substituting glass in lieu of the heavy shutters which
were then in use; and great astonishment was excited, and supernatural
agency suspected, when the moon and stars were seen through a material
which excluded the inclemency of the weather. York Cathedral was glazed
about the same time; and in the eleventh and twelfth centuries, when a
great stimulus was given to the erection of religious edifices, glass
was generally employed in the windows. It appears to have been used in
domestic architecture but very sparingly, till a much later period, when
it came to be gradually adopted in the residences of the wealthy. As
late as the middle of the sixteenth century it was recommended, in a
survey of the Duke of Northumberland's estates, that the glass in the
windows should be taken down, and laid by in safety during the absence
of the Duke and his family, and be replaced on his return; as this would
be attended with smaller cost than the repair rendered necessary by
damage or decay. In Ray's <i>Itinerary</i> it is mentioned that in Scotland,
even in 1661, the windows of ordinary houses were not glazed, and those
only of the principal chambers of the King's palaces had glass; the
lower ones being supplied with shutters, to admit light and air at
pleasure.</p>

<p>Plate glass for mirrors and coach windows was introduced into England by
the second Duke of Buckingham, who brought over workmen from Venice, and
established a manufactory at Lambeth, where the works were carried on
successfully according to the process in use at Venice.</p>

<p>The first manufactory for cast plate glass, according to the process
invented by Abraham Thévart, was established in 1773, at Prescot in
Lancashire, by a society of gentlemen, to whom a royal charter was
granted, under the name of the "British Plate Glass Company."</p>

<p>&mdash;As your correspondent has no faith
in Spruner, but appears to have confidence in Kiepert, it may serve him
to be informed that there is a General Map of Africa by Kiepert
published in 1850, and that Drs. Barth and Overweg, the travellers in
Africa, have this map with them: also, that Kiepert published a map of
Algiers, Fez, and Morocco, Tunis, Tripoli, &amp;c. There is also another map
by Kiepert, of the Roman Empire in the first centuries of the Christian
era, which includes the northern coast of Africa.</p>

   <p>The publication of <i>The Works of Sir Thomas Browne</i>, vol. iii.,
   containing "Urn Burial," "Christian Morals," "Miscellanies,"
   "Correspondence," &amp;c., edited by Simon Wilkins, completes this
   important contribution to Bohn's <i>Antiquarian Library</i>. We could
   have wished that it had not been included in this series, for we
   fear that circumstance may deter many from purchasing it; and the
   writings of Browne may still be read by all with interest and
   advantage, for, "of the esteem of posterity," said Johnson, "he
   will not easily be deprived, while learning shall have any
   reverence among men; for there is no science in which he does not
   discover some skill; and scarce any kind of knowledge, profane or
   sacred, abstruse or elegant, which he does not appear to have
   cultivated with success;" and these writings, with Mr. Wilkins's
   notes, may now be placed upon our shelves for fifteen shillings!</p>

   <p>If, when speaking of the discovery of electro-magnetism by
   Professor Oersted, Sir John Herschel did not hesitate to declare
   "that the Electric Telegraph, and other wonders of modern
   science, were but mere effervescences from the surface of this
   deep recondite discovery which Oersted had liberated, and which
   was yet to burst with all its mighty force upon the world," he
   paid only a just compliment to the merits of the great
   physicist&mdash;and he really did no more&mdash;it is obvious<a id="Page_383"></a> <span class="pagenum">[383]</span> that
   Mr. Bohn, in giving as a new volume of his <i>Scientific Library</i>,
   a translation of <i>The Soul in Nature, with Supplementary
   Contributions</i>, by Hans Christian Oersted, has rendered a great
   service to scientific men. And it would seem, moreover, from the
   dedication of the translators, that in executing their labour
   they have been fulfilling Oersted's own wish, that a true
   representation of his views of nature should be presented to the
   English public.</p>

Students; with a PARSING INDEX, containing the Words which occur, and
showing their derivations.</p>

<p><i>This Lexicon will be found to be the fullest and most comprehensive
Lexicon to the Greek Testament, which has yet been published, at a
moderate price. It is compiled from Dr. Robinson's large work, but on
comparison it will be found that nothing really essential has been
omitted.</i></p>

<p><i>For the sake of the many private students who, not having had the
benefit of a regular classical education, are pursuing their studies
under great disadvantages, a Parsing Index is appended which gives the
form of all the words as they occur in the Testament, with a reference
to the word from which they are derived.</i></p>

  <p class="blockquot"> "Making use of the well-directed labour and well-earned fame of
   Dr. Robinson's 'Lexicon,' an English editor prepares this
   condensed work for the use of schools and students. Utility is
   the main object aimed at, so far as the young scholar is
   concerned, and therefore those parts of the original work are
   most fully given which are most essential to those who are only
   learners. Thus the inflexions of all verbs in any degree
   irregular appear in their orders, and in an appendix a copious
   parsing index is given.<br />

  "Dr. Robinson's Lexicon aimed at being also a concordance, and
   almost all passages of importance were referred to under each
   word; here there is only a selection of those references thought
   either most striking or most varied. In general, the editing of
   the work manifests judgment, and in some points, special care has
   been bestowed; as in the Explanations and Illustrations of the
   use of the Particles&mdash;a subject in which English-Greek Lexicons
   are usually deficient. For those who have only a slight knowledge
   of the Greek language, no Lexicon will be found more useful than
   'Robinson's Lexicon Condensed.'"&mdash;<i>Literary Gazette</i>, Nov. 22. 1851.</p>

   <p class="blockquot">"This is a well-executed and useful condensation of the last
   edition of Dr. Robinson's excellent Lexicon. The abridgment has
   been mainly effected by the reduction of the number of examples
   given in the larger work. Dr. Robinson aimed to make his book not
   merely a Lexicon, but a Concordance; and, therefore prints far
   more examples (where they exist) than is necessary to elucidate
   the meaning or construction: <i>e.g.</i>, if the phrase occurs six or
   eight times, he cites every passage containing it. Whatever
   advantage this plan might possess in the original work, it could
   not be suited to one intended mainly for learners; the present
   editor has, therefore, found the chief opportunity for the
   exercise of his judgment in the selection from them of the
   examples really necessary, apart from the idea of making the work
   a concordance, and this task seems to have been executed by a
   skillful hand; and notwithstanding the great reduction of bulk
   and, consequently, of cost, the work remains quite adequate for
   the purposes of learners and school purposes, and is, indeed, the
   best adapted to this use of any that has fallen under our notice.
   A serviceable Parsing Index is appended, extending to fifty-five
   pages. This is a feature only to be found in 'Dawson's Lexicon'
   which is useless as a help to the critical study of the New
   Testament."&mdash;<i>Kitto's Journal of Sacred Literature.</i></p>

   <p class="blockquot">"We can honestly recommend this Condensed Lexicon to students of
   the Greek New Testament. The Parsing Index is invaluable to those
   who have not been prepared, by classical discipline in Grammar,
   to see, at a glance, the derivations of words, and the moods and
   tenses of verbs. The inflexions of irregular verbs, the analysis
   of compound words, the varied and delicate uses of Greek
   particles by Hebrew writers, and the well-selected examples of
   interpretation, are given so clearly and concisely, that we know
   not any other book so thoroughly adapted to the purpose. We are
   not informed who the Editor is: he has certainly undertaken a
   good work, and done it admirably."&mdash;<i>Eclectic Review</i>, Feb. 1852.</p>

  <p class="blockquot"> "We have no hesitation in saying that, whoever the editor may be,
   he has done his work well. Every word occurring in the New
   Testament is correctly explained and amply illustrated with
   suitable examples. An excellent idea not merely of the various
   shades of meaning which each is capable of bearing, but also of
   the different combinations into which it enters, may be gathered
   from the phrases quoted or referred to. All Hebraisms and
   peculiar constructions are fully exemplified. Great attention is
   given to the prepositions and particles, which play so important
   a part in the Greek language. Peculiarities of inflection are
   stated, and the derivation is explained, generally with undoubted
   accuracy. A vocabulary is given at the end, by consulting which
   even those who have but slender acquaintance with Greek grammar
   may without difficulty parse every word in the
   Testament."&mdash;<i>Athenæum.</i></p>

<p class="center larger">TOMB OF<br />
 THE TRADESCANTS.</p>

<p>In Lambeth Churchyard is a Monument, once handsome and elaborately
carved, which was erected in 1662 by the widow of JOHN TRADESCANT the
younger, to the memory of her father-in-law, her husband, and her son,
who were inhabitants of that parish.</p>

<p>The Monument of the TRADESCANTS, which was repaired by public
subscription in 1773, has now again fallen into decay. The inscription
also on the stone that covers ASHMOLE'S grave, who was himself buried in
Lambeth Church, is now very nearly effaced. The restoration of that
Church, now nearly finished, seems a fit occasion for repairing both
these Monuments. It is therefore proposed to raise a fund for the
perfect restoration of the Tomb of the TRADESCANTS, according to its
original form, as represented in two drawings preserved in the Pepysian
Library at Cambridge, and also for renewing ASHMOLE's epitaph. The cost
will not be less than 100<i>l.</i>, and assistance is earnestly requested
from all who are anxious to preserve ancient monuments, especially those
who are following the same pursuits as the TRADESCANTS and who are daily
deriving benefit and delight from the labours and discoveries of these
first of English gardeners and naturalists.</p>
